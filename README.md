# Project Stuff

To get the source code on your machine, open up Git Bash, navigate to the folder you want to store things in, and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/strictlyaformality/hanginwithmrcooper
```
**Tip:** You can **paste** into a bash/cmd window by **right-clicking** on it.

To run the project (this can be from a regular cmd/terminal window):
```bash
cd hanginwithmrcooper
npm install
npm start
```

If you don't see any terrifying red text or get flooded with errors, you should be able to navigate to
``` 
localhost:8080
```
in your browser to view the application skeleton.

## README: A reading list
Navigate to
```
localhost:8080/readme
```
in your browser to view this skeleton.

**Note**: All constants, variables, and functions should be defined in the **readme/script.js** file

1. Define an array of books named **books**. You should **let** this array be variable. A book is comprised of **5** properties: 
  + title (a unique **string**)
  + author (**string**)
  + genres (**Array&lt;string&gt;**)
  + read (**boolean**)
  + pages (**number**)
2. Define **3** functions to filter the **books** array. The string provided to these functions will be whatever string is present in the textbox at the top of the page. One of these functions will be invoked whenever a character is added/removed to the textbox or a different filter is chosen in the selectbox 
```javascript 
filterByAuthor(Array<Book>, string) => Array<Book> 
```
```javascript
filterByTitle(Array<Book>, string) => Array<Book>
``` 
```javascript
filterByGenre(Array<Book>, string) => Array<Book>
```
3. Define a function to filter books by length. The string provided to these functions will be one of **all**, **short**, **medium**, **long**. It's up to you to decide the range of page lengths that corresponds to each string. This function is invoked when a radio button is selected at the top of the page.
```javascript
filterByLength(Array<Book>, string) => Array<Book>
```
4. Define a function to toggle the *read* status of the book. It will be invoked when the checkboxes present in each individual entry are toggled. The function will be provided a the title of the book being toggled (as a **string**) and a **boolean** representing the new *read* status of the book:
```javascript
toggleReadStatus(Array<Book>, string, boolean) => Array<Book>
```
5. Define a function to toggle the *read* status of all books. This function will also receive a **boolean** value representing the new *read* status of *all* the books. It will be invoked when the checkbox at the top of the page is toggled:
```javascript
toggleAllReadStatus(Array<Book>, boolean) => Array<Book>
```

Once these constants, variables, and functions are in place, you should have a functioning (and horribly colored) little application.
